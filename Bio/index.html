        <p>
          When I was five years old, my parents gifted me with a Nintendo Entertainment 
          System for Christmas. It was a very long time ago, but I still remember opening
          it that Christmas Eve, beaming with happiness as I ripped the wrapping paper
          off in a frenzy of excitement. That was probably one of the happiest moments I can 
          recall, and it probably changed my life forever. I grew to love that little machine,  
          and somewhere along the way I decided I wanted to make games when I grew up. At the 
          time I didn't know how to go about doing that exactly, but I knew that it was 
          what I wanted to do. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My father however, did not approve. He came from a traditional upbringing and 
          couldn't see the value in games, nor how making them could result in a career that  
          could support me, much less a family of my own and as such he discouraged me from  
          this path. So I forgot about my dreams as time went on, and I eventually forgot  
          about my dreams of making games altogether, or at least for a while I did anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, there was a period of time when I was unsure of where I was really going or   
          what I was doing with my life. In that darkness, I turned to the things that  
          brought me the most comfort when I was young; video games, and it was in that    
          comfort that I found my purpose. After a while, I began to wonder and form ideas
          about how I would make a game if I could. Then one day, I just woke up and decided 
          that I was going to go for it, I was going to make a game. I had no idea what I 
          was in for.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have always been a highly creative and intelligent person with a natural instinct 
          for working with people and technology. I was recognized for my artistic  
          ability at a young age and have been around computers for as long as I can remember. 
          Initially, I started programming because of my passion for video games, but 
          eventually I came to discover an innate skill and passion for problem-solving and 
          technology that I never knew I had within me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Life has not been easy for me though. I grew up fairly poor with few opportunities.  
          My mother is disabled, and being her only child I have had to step up to take care of 
          her, which has required many sacrifices on my part. I have known many challenges but 
          I know who I am and what I'm made of. I am resilient, astute, innovative, adaptable, 
          inquisitive and pragmatic. I dream big and I'm optimistic about my future and my 
          potential. I'm proud of the obstacles I have overcome, as well as how I've grown 
          through these challenges, where I am and where I'm going. I'm looking forward to 
          the next stage of my life, manifesting positive changes, and meeting opportunity 
          as it presents itself. Join me on my journey as bring my dreams into reality and 
          create the kind of games I've always wanted to play.
