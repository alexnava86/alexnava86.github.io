          <h3>Adventure Game</h3>
          <p>
            "Adventure Game" is a 2D side-scrolling fantasy/sci-fi action-adventure 
            RPG with platforming elements. Set in an isolated fantasy world with a buried  
            technological past, a young guard stumbles upon an ancient existential threat 
            facing their world. Explore several large overworld map areas with lots of nooks 
            and crannies, many rich levels full of secrets and lively towns with interesting
            NPCs. Find weapons, abilities and power-ups throughout your journey, face off  
            against challenging enemies and bosses, and uncover the secrets and lore of this 
            mysterious and ancient world.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Adventure Game" was originally conceieved of by my friend Ryan Elmore, who   
            handles most of the creative aspects, while I focus on technical development and 
            project management. You can check out the state of the project below. It is
            (somewhat) playable in its current state on Itch.io, and also available to view  
            as a Github repo of the Unity Project.
          </p>

          <h3>Galaxy Stone</h3>
          <p>
            Currently on hiatus. Originally conceived of by my friend Ben Hance. Galaxy Stone 
            is a turn-based Strategy-RPG set in a strange and alien world about creatures 
            defending their home planet against hostile invaders.
          </p>
          <p>
            It isn't quite playable in its current state, but it is on Itch.io, and also 
            available as a Github repo of the Unity Project.
          </p>

          <h3>True Story</h3>
          <p>
            This is where it all began for me. 'True Story' was the first project I started
            working on when I first decided I wanted to build games. 'True Story' is a love 
            letter to the golden era of 16-bit RPGs. It is a top-down Action-RPG about a boy 
            and his companions who must save the world, set in a wacky Earth-like planet.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had big dreams for this project, but at the time I didn't really understand how 
            difficult it would be to develop something of this scope on my own and 
            unfortunately I eventually decided to put it on hiatus to work on other projects, 
            which isn't to say that it's never going to happen. I intend to come back to it 
            someday when I can afford the time and perhaps enlist some more help. It isn't
            very playable in its current state, though it is on Itch.io and also available
            as a Github repo of the Unity Project.
